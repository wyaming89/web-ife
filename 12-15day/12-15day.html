                <p>Hi guys lve got the O2 package and have really slow inernet. A speed check online said
                I can get 2mbps but it seems more like 0.5 these days, just freezing and taking ages to open
                pages and open audio files for example. I have decided to switch to the UPC package which offers
                10mbps but do you think I will get it?</p>

                <p>I have internet for 9 month and never could benfilt form the full capacity of 5Mbit/s as it is filtered by
                O2 when it detect traffic on public pap sharing in my situation all my internet speed slows to 512Kbit/s
                I never had 400KB/s on when downloading from p2p public servers like torrent emule etc. I download with 500KB/s
                    from private trakers instead. So conlcusion O2 block trafic on p2p conntctions. I have made hundreds of test in Italy and
               and Sweden and Romania with same file to download with the same setting and same antivirus and just needed to
                open ports in firewall and forward same ports and the speed was at full capacity in 1 minute. here in 9month
                never had this luck.</p>

                <p>Funny comparison. so would the proper antivirus not slow down the internet as much or do you mean a
                freeble doenst protect the computer from viruese?</p>

                <p>I pay for the 4Mb/sec down 512Kb/sec up service from O2, and haven't had any problems in fact, it's
                relatively quick, and stable.it's not perfect, but I really don't have issues, as longs as I keep track
                of what I'm doing on it. I max out at about 3Mb/sec down, and 350Kb/sec up, Probably because of a noisy
                telephone line, not because I'm being throttled, When my uploads go over 25KB/sec(note, bytes,not bits),
                my download speed suffers.This is expected, as downloads require upload bandwidth as well<img src="img/pic_44.png">
